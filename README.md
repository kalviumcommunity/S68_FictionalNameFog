### Mongo Atlas Connection
Added entity data to Mongo, and connected to the Mongo Database.

### CRUD Operations
Created CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and tested with Bruno API Testing.

### Base Frontend Setup
Created Vite setup for frontend and created a landing page with 4 buttons based on Key Features.

Landing page only has buttons because there is no design as of yet, and the buttons are in name only to show what key features will be available.
